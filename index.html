        <h2>Life of Andrew Ryan:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1910</b> - Andrew Ryan, born in a village near Minsk in the Russian Empire (modern day Belarus).</li>
          <li><b>1917</b> - Witnessed the Russian Revolution, which eventually brought the Bolsheviks into power.</li>
          <li><b>1919</b> - A young Andrew Ryan fled to America, believing it to be a place where a great man could prosper, just before Belarus and multiple other countries such as Ukraine and Russia formed to create the Soviet Union in 1922.</li>
          <li><b>1945</b> - Horrified by the Hiroshima bombing, Andrew Ryan used his entire fortune to build Rapture; a community where "the artist would not fear the censor, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality, where the great would not be constrained by the small," in the only place he felt the "Parasites" could not touchâ€”the depths of the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
          <li><b>1946</b> - Rapture experienced tremendous economic progress, and solid political stability. As Ryan predicted, citizens in Rapture created a culture of entrepreneurship that was unrivaled, with numerous businesses established and unprecedented scientific advancements, including the discovery of ADAM by Brigid Tenenbaum.</li>
          <li><b>1956</b> - Ryan unknowingly impregnated an Eve's Garden exotic dancer named Jasmine Jolene.</li>
          <li><b>1958</b> - Civil war broke out in Rapture due to an &ldquo;incident&rdquo; that occured at the Kashmir Restaurant, where a masquerade ball thrown for Rapture's elite was being held.</li>
          <li><b>1960</b> - Was blugeoned to death by his genetically modified son, Jack, with a golf club after having used an embedded trigger phrase to force his son to do so.</li>
        </ul>
